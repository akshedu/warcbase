Warcbase
========

Warcbase is an open-source platform for managing web archives built on Hadoop and HBase. The platform provides a flexible data model for storing and managing raw content as well as metadata and extracted knowledge. Tight integration with Hadoop provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing via Spark.

**Bad news**: Warcbase is defunct and no longer under active development!

**Good news**: In June 2017, the University of Waterloo and York University were awarded [a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/news/multidisciplinary-project-will-help-historians-unlock) to build the next generation of tools that will make historical internet content accessible to scholars. Warcbase serves as the foundation for the [ArchivesUnleashed Toolkit](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut)!
